We were supposed to learn/ accomplish with working with files in reading and writing, working  with function and working with tables and or lists. The key concpets were just using the code for openig the file which was given by professor. The results did match and no we did not do any test cases. Challenges were with I would say would be the getting rid of the colons. But then leaf thought of split funciton and we were able to complete it. Used the first three rules of programming by just thinking about the process before we started it. It was great working with leaf he was super nice and actually was teaching me some stuff.
